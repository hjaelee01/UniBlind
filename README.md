# UniVeil

Welcome to a unique townsquare for [University of Edinburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh) where students can freely share their down-to-earth and ~~sometimes brutally~~ candid opinions and explore the thoughts of their fellow university peers.

What sets this site apart?
1. **Every member is a verified student.** We verify each member's student email address to ensure that everyone on the site is a current or former student.
